Note: all these previews are from the original html contained in the source code, and not the initial UI figma design - I cannot obtain these files anymore.
Therefore, some areas or layouts might be a bit rough.

Next agendas of project:
- restructure in React
  -- I want to transition from using legacy Bootstrap and JQuery, it's making the code too messy and I'd like to make the code as clean as the Backend Code.
